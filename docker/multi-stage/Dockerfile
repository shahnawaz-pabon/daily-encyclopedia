## We'll choose the incredibly lightweight
## Go alpine image to work with
FROM golang:1.18.0-alpine3.15 AS builder

## We create an /app directory in which
## we'll put all of our project code
RUN mkdir /app
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

## We want to build our application's binary executable
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o main ./...

## the lightweight scratch image we'll
## run our application within
FROM alpine:latest AS production

## We have to copy the output from our
## builder stage to our production stage
COPY --from=builder /app .

## we can then kick off our newly compiled
## binary exectuable!!
